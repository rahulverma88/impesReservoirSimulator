# IMPES Reservoir Simulator

Based on Larry Lake's graduate level reservoir simulation course

I did the original course in Matlab, this project is for porting that to Python, and potentially C/C++.

If you are taking the course, do not copy this code, as it is easy to check plagiarism in projects.
